# Recipes
Quick working examples for some typical and some unusual tasks.  Some are written in Python, some in Java, but
I have not separaetd them out because they are all script-like applications.

# Criteria for a recipe
* The recipe has to be a working program
* But the recipe should perform only one or two tasks 
* The task should be a connectivity task that is simple, but that a devloper might get stuck on for one reason or another.
* As many dependencies as possible should be stripped out of the example
