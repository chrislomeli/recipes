# s3 file crawler
A simple utility to demonstrate listing an S3 bucket/folder.

## motivation
Managing S3 objects is better accomplished using a utility like aws cli.  But s3 is a great way to publishing data sets to other teams and companies, and if you need to provide an sdk or a website for searching for a particular file with a pattern search, this is q simple working starter.   Most of this is directly from AWS documentation, but it can save time to provide a working build that they can step through.
